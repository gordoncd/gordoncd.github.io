For the inaugural installment of learning layers, my data science and machine learning blog, the topic will be linear programming. 

# Linear Programming

#### What is Linear Programming? 

Broadly speaking, linear programming (linear optimization) is an optimization process of a linear function.  One can choose between minimizing and maximizing the function of interest, the only requiremetn is that function is linear. In other words, the function must be able to be expressed as follows: 

$f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{c}^T\mathbf{x}$

Where x and c are both vectors, and c is a vector of constants. 

Furthermore, this we are required to have additional bounds else $\mathbf{x}\rightarrow{}\infty$ or $x\rightarrow{}0$ would be allowed.

So we can assign additional boundaries to $\mathbf{x}$. Principally, $\mathbf{x} < b$ for some $b\in{\mathbb{R}^n}$. The value of b should be defined based on the problem one is trying to solve.  More on that later.

## Linear Programming is Intuitively a Geometric Endeavor

### What is geometric methods are too hard? 

## Algorithmic Approaches to Linear Programming

#### Simplex Method:

**pivoting**
Losen one constraint, tighten another
In other words, get closer to one of our boundaries, while traversing away from another. 

Record behavior along different critical points
save the best one

slack variables are applied to each equation in a system and correspond to the variables present in a given equation 

These turn inequalities into equalities.

A tight inequality occurs when s_n is set to 0 in the equality version.  They become a boolean determining whether we a position is tight.

x and s variables can be loose or tight, and one just needs to check 

SELECT A VARIABLE TO LOOSEN:
Dantzig's pivot method
select variable with largest positive coefficient in the objective function

look at equalities where the loosened variable appears. Of any loose variables present, one chooses **one** to tighten.  This is selected based on the ratio between the selected variable and the constants in the equations where it appears. Pick the loose variable in the funciton with the **largest nonpositive ratio** between the selected variable and the constant in its equation.  

We've now loosened and tightened a pair of variables, so we need to move our equations around so loose variables are on the left and tight variables on the right. 

We then have a new equation for our selected variable, and we subsitute that into wherever it used to exist. 

### Duality:

Bounding our objective function to demonstrate optimal solution has been found. 

(weak duality theorem)

We want an equality

(strong duality theorem)

if the primal has an optimum, we can always find duality

### A simple example: Farming Profit

You are a farmer who grows two types of crops: rice and corn. You have a limited amount of land (100 acres) and resources (water and labor). Each acre of rice requires 2 hours of labor and 1 unit of water, while each acre of corn requires 3 hours of labor and 2 units of water. You make \$200 profit per acre of rice and \$150 profit per acre of corn. 

#### Objective:
Maximize total profit defined by $P = 200W + 150C$

#### Constraints:
1. Total land: \(R + C \leq 100\) (where \(W\) is acres of rice and \(C\) is acres of corn)
2. Labor: \(2R + 3C \leq 200\) (hours of labor)
3. Water: \(R + 2C \leq 100\) (units of water)

### Solution:
We can represent this problem graphically or solve it using optimization techniques to find the combination of rice and corn that maximizes profit while respecting the constraints.

#### Let's first solve this graphically: 

(plot of the given constraints, with the innera area shaded and the lines labeled accordin got what they mean as defined in the constraints section)

#### Now let's demonstrate the Simplex Method:
